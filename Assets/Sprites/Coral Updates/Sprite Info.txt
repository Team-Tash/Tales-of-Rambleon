Updates
-----------------------
Any updates to sprites will be added to this folder to minimise issues. 
To update the cut sprite sheets, open the file locations and copy these files to the location of the new ones.
Any sprites with the same name will be updated and this will not affect the way they are cut. 


Naming Conventions
-----------------------
Sprite sheets will be named after their type and then their style e.g. FloorCloudSprites

Choose a naming system for when the sprites are cut e.g. FloorCloudSprites_Left, 
so that if the sprite sheet is rearranged in future, it will be easy to recut and name the 
sprites so that nothing in the scene needs to be changed. 


Sprite Size
-----------------------
Floor tiles: 32x32
Background objects: no size template
Midground objects: 32x32 grid alignment
Foreground objects: ???
Custom backgrounds: send me a list of dimensions


Sprite Issues
-----------------------
For sprite inconsistencies, send me a screenshot with the sprite sheet name.
